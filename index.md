# Here is a link to all of the programs that I have written by myself in CS36 (C Programming) class

**Some things about me**


*1.* I really really like anything with sustainable fashion.

*2.* I have my own Instagram food blog, @eatingwithcaths on Instagram.

*3.* I may or may not have a slight obsession with cows and cow squishmallows.

*4.* Most of my college dorm and desk consist of either pink, white, black, or sage green colors (even my VSCode is in a sage green theme)


**Here are the links to my program files now**
